# **Packages**

This folder contains **Tanium Packages** used for endpoint management. Each package typically includes:

* **Command logic** – the task to be executed on endpoints (e.g., uninstall, cleanup).
* **Attached scripts** – supporting PowerShell or shell scripts.
* **Verification query** – used to confirm whether the package succeeded.

These packages are designed for **deployment via Tanium Actions** or as part of **Engage Remediations**.
