# **Queries**

This folder contains **Tanium Interact Saved Questions** used for endpoint visibility, compliance, and security auditing.

Each query is documented to include:

* **Purpose** – what the query is designed to detect or report on.
* **Scope** – which endpoint types are targeted (e.g., workstations, servers, all entities).
* **Filters** – sensors, regex exclusions, or OS type conditions applied.
* **Example Output** – expected columns (e.g., `Host Name`, `User Accounts`).
* **Usage** – how to run in Interact, save as a Saved Question, or link to dashboards.

Queries can be combined with **Packages** in Engage Remediations to provide detection → action workflows.
