# DNS Cache Flush with Logging

This PowerShell script captures and logs the systemâ€™s DNS cache before and after a flush operation.  


---

##  Script Overview

The script performs the following actions:
1. Creates a dedicated log directory (`C:\Logs\DnsCacheFlush\`) if it does not exist.  
2. Captures and saves the current DNS client cache to `DnsCacheBeforeFlush.txt`.  
3. Executes a system-level DNS cache flush using `ipconfig /flushdns`.  
4. Waits 2 seconds, then captures and saves the new DNS client cache to `DnsCacheAfterFlush.txt`.  
5. Logs all major operations and warnings to the console for traceability.
