# Overview
 `Stop-MSIProcesses.ps1`  is a PowerShell remediation script designed to be deployed via Microsoft Intune. Its primary function is to identify and terminate any MSI (Windows Installer) processes currently running on a machine.

 ` Another installation is already in progress. Complete that installation before proceeding. (0x80070652) `

This error typically occurs when another MSI process is running in the backgroundâ€”often caused by a previous or concurrent application deployment. These stalled or stuck MSI processes can bottleneck application installations pushed via Intune or similar deployment tools.

By forcefully terminating any active MSI installer processes, this script clears the blockage and allows pending installations to proceed successfully. This is especially useful in environments where timely software deployment is critical and automated interventions are preferred.
