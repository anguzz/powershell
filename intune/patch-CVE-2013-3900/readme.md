# README: Patch Script for CVE-2013-3900 (WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation)

## Overview

This package is designed to apply the necessary configuration changes to mitigate the **WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation Vulnerability**, identified by **CVE-2013-3900**, on Microsoft Windows systems.

## Vulnerability Description (CVE-2013-3900)

* **Identifier:** CVE-2013-3900
* **Issue:** This vulnerability concerns the way the `WinVerifyTrust` function handles the verification of PE (Portable Executable) files signed with Authenticode signatures. Specifically, it involves how padding or extra content within the signature block could be manipulated.
* **Impact:** An attacker could potentially append malicious content to a legitimately signed executable file without invalidating the signature. This could allow malware to masquerade as trusted software, potentially leading to remote code execution if a user is persuaded to run the crafted file.
* **Microsoft Response:** Microsoft addressed this vulnerability via Security Advisory 2893294 and subsequent updates. The fix involved enabling stricter file signature validation. Initially, this was often deployed as an opt-in registry change before being integrated more broadly.


## Usage

-   **Execution:**
    * Open PowerShell or Command Prompt **as Administrator**.
    * Navigate to the directory containing the script.
    * Execute the script with admin credentials (`.\install.ps1` ):

     
 -  **Verification:** (Optional) The script might output a success message. You can also manually check the relevant registry keys if known. A system reboot might be required for the changes to take full effect.
