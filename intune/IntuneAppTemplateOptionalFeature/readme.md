# Windows Optional Feature Detection Script (for Intune)

This PowerShell script checks if a specific Windows Optional Feature (e.g., .NET Framework 3.5, Telnet Client, XPS Viewer) is **enabled** on a Windows system. It is intended for use with Microsoft Intune Win32 application deployments to determine whether a feature is already installed before installation or to confirm removal.
